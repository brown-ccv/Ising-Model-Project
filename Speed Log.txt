16 cores, N=50, 35 seconds, 35 seconds  (took 49 seconds, 41 seconds respectively on my laptop)
16 cores, N=100, 271.790490 seconds, 271.790490 seconds —(4.52 minutes)
16 cores N=300, 6983.273645 seconds, 6983.273645 seconds —1 hours 54 minutes each
16 cores N=400, 16435.154232 seconds  —4 hours and 33 minutes each
